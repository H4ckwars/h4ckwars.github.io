## User Interface & UX

The user interface design was originally inspired by [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).  
The color palette has since been adapted to better suit the project's identity and can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/9fef00-9aa3b2-0b121f-fafafa-e60000).

### Logo

The logo displayed below is the **only official and approved version**.  
Its proportions and colors must **not** be modified under any circumstances.

The website uses two main fonts:  
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=Hackwars&lang=de_Latn) for general text  
- [Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed?preview.text=HACKWARS) for headings

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — used for building the frontend and server-side rendering  
- **Runtime:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — executes server-side logic  
- **Database Integration:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) — used as an ORM for database interaction (more details in the [Backend Overview](../backend/overview))


## Component Structure
Every page is represented as a separate folder within the app directory.
Folders wrapped in brackets (e.g., [id]) indicate dynamically generated routes.
Reusable components are placed in the components directory.
If a component was imported using shadcn/ui, it resides in the components/ui subfolder.
The constants file is used to define the navigation structure, making it easy to scale and add new entries without changing layout logic.
The lib folder contains shared configuration files, such as:
- The logging setup
- The database connection


```sh
├── app
│   ├── admin-panel
│   │   ├── games
│   │   │   └── [gameId]
│   │   └── users
│   ├── api
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── games
│   │   └── [id]
│   ├── imprint
│   ├── leaderboard
│   └── (root)
├── components
│   └── ui
├── constants
└── lib
```


## Routing
The routing in the application is based on the App Router where each route corresponds to a dedicated folder within the app directory.
Dynamic routes are defined using square brackets, for example: /app/[gameId], allowing pages to be generated based on URL parameters.
