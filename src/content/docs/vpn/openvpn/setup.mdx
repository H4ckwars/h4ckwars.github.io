title: VPN | OpenVPN | Installation & Setup
description: Placeholder
---


For this whole setup, a setup script was created. You can find this setup script in our [Git Repository](https://github.com/H4ckwars/VPN-Server)


## Setup

First all needed packages are installed:
```bash
sudo apt install -y openvpn easy-rsa
sudo apt install -y python3-dotenv
```

Then the Certificate Authority is build:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/easyrsa build-ca nopass
```

Now the Request and Keys can be Generated:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/easyrsa gen-req "game_vpn" nopass
```

Then the Diffie-Hellman Parameters are generated:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/easyrsa gen-dh
```

Then the Server Certificate is signed:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/easyrsa sign-req server "game_vpn"
```

Then the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is being generated:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/easyrsa gen-crl
```

Then a static Key is generated for the TLS Authentication:
```bash
sudo openvpn --genkey secret ta.key
```

Finally the OpenVPN server is beeing enabled and started:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable openvpn@game_vpn
sudo systemctl start openvpn@game_vpn
```

## Configuration


The whole config of an OpenVPN server is stored in the file `/etc/openvpn/<server_name>.conf`.
This is how our OpenVPN configuration file looks like:

```
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun

ca ca.crt
cert game_vpn.crt
key game_vpn.key

dh dh.pem
crl-verify /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/crl.pem

server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

ifconfig-pool-persist /var/log/openvpn/ipp.txt

client-config-dir ccd

keepalive 10 120
tls-auth ta.key 0
cipher AES-256-CBC
persist-key
persist-tun

status /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
log         /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log
log-append  /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log
