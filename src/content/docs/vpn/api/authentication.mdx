title: VPN | API | Authentication
description: VPN endpoints.

To ensure that only authorized users can access the VPN API endpoints, 
authentication is enforced using an API key. 

The `X-API-Key` field in the request header is compared against a predefined 
value stored in the `.env` file. This ensures that no unauthorized requests 
can generate new clients or perform other actions.

Authentication is implemented using Flask's `app.before_request` decorator, 
which executes a function before every incoming request. 
This function validates the API key and blocks any requests with invalid or missing keys.
```python
@app.before_request
def authenticate_api_key():
    api_key = request.headers.get('x-api-key')
    if api_key != API_KEY:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Unauthorized'}), 401
```

This key is stored in the `.env` file and is loaded into the application using the `dotenv` library.

The same key is also stored in Game APIs `.env`, which is used to call the VPN API.
