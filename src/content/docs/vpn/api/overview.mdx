description: VPN API.
---

The VPN API is responsible for automated Client creation and Client Revocation.
In order for this to work, the API needs to have command line access to the VPN Server. So the API is not deployed via a Dockcer Container but via a Systemd service.
In addition the API manages the iptable Rules to limit the users access in the Proxmox network.

## Functions

The API uses several functions to manage the API Requests:
- **run_command(command):** Runs a command in the terminal and returns the output.
- **create_iptable_rules(client_ip):** Calculates the game network IP using the client IP and sets the correct iptables rules to allow communication.
- **remove_iptable_rules(client_ip):** Calculates the game network IP using the client IP and removes the iptables rules.
- **generate_client(client_name, ip):** Generates a new client with all the necessary certificates.
- **revoke_client_cert(client_name):** Revokes the client certificates.
- **network_config(client_name, ip):** Generates network configuration for the client with a file under `/etc/openvpn/ccd/`.
- **remove_network_config(client_name):** Removes the previously created network configuration file.
- **create_ovpn_file(client_name):** Generates a configuration file for a client with all the needed certificates.


## Iptables Rules

To ensure that clients can only access the game they are actively playing, iptables rules must be added dynamically. 

The VPN-Networks are mapped to the Game Networks as follows:
```
game_network: 10.2.X.1/24
vpn_network: 10.12.X.1/24
```
- The second octet of the IP address is incremented by 10 to derive the VPN network from the game network.
- The `X` in the IP address identifies the specific running game.


### Connection Rules
The VPN Server must allow communication between the following:
- From `10.2.X.1` (Game Network) to `10.12.X.1` (VPN Network)
- From `10.12.X.1` (VPN Network) to `10.2.X.1` (Game Network)

### Rule Management
- **One Rule Per Game:** Each game requires a single iptables rule.
- **Two Clients Per Game:** Since there are two clients per game, the VPN API must ensure that:
  - The iptables rules for a specific game are added only once, even if two clients are created in the same game network.
  - The iptables rules are removed only when the last client in a game network is removed.

To manage the iptables rules effectively, the VPN API keeps track of the number of clients in each game network using a dictionary:

```
client_count = {"<vpn-network>": <client_count>}
```
- The dictionary is updated whenever a client is created or revoked.
- The iptables rules are added or removed based on the client count in the dictionary.


## Client Creation

To create a new client you first have to generate a client certificate:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa gen-req {client_name} nopass
```

Then you can sign the client certificate:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa sign-req client {client_name}
```

Then a netowrk configuration file is generated for the client with a file under `/etc/openvpn/ccd/`:
```
ifconfig-push {ip} 255.255.255.0
push "route {net_id} 255.255.255.0
```


Then to generate the client configuration you first have to get the CA, Cert, Key and TLS Auth Key:
```
ca: /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt
cert: /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/{client_name}.crt
key: /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/{client_name}.key
tls_auth: /etc/openvpn/ta.key
```

Then you can just use this template and insert all the values:
```
client
dev tun
proto udp
remote {VPN_SERVER_IP} 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
remote-cert-tls server
cipher AES-256-CBC
key-direction 1
verb 3
<ca>
{ca}
</ca>
<cert>
{cert}
</cert>
<key>
{key}
</key>
<tls-auth>
{tls_auth}
</tls-auth>
```

Then if it is the first client in the game network, the iptables rules are added:
```bash
iptables -A FORWARD -s {game_network} -d {vpn_network} -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -s {vpn_network} -d {game_network} -j ACCEPT
```

## Client Revocation
To revoke a client certificate you can use the following command:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa revoke {client_name}
```

Then you have to generate a new CRL:
```bash
/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa gen-crl
```

Then you have to remove the network configuration file:
```python
os.remove(f"/etc/openvpn/ccd/{client_name}")
```

Then if it is the last client in the game network, the iptables rules are removed:
```bash
iptables -D FORWARD -s {game_network} -d {vpn_network} -j ACCEPT
iptables -D FORWARD -s {vpn_network} -d {game_network} -j ACCEPT
```
