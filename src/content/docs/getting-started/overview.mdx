Hackwars is a real-time, 1v1 cybersecurity game that combines both attack and defense elements. 
Each player is assigned a vulnerable server to protect while simultaneously attempting to 
exploit their opponent's server. Inspired by Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenges, Hackwars 
provides a competitive and dynamic platform for testing offensive and defensive hacking skills.

## Platform Features

- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Players compete live in a 1v1 attack-and-defense scenario
- **Dynamic VM Management**: Virtual machines are automatically started, stopped, and removed for each game session
- **VPN Integration**: Each player receives a secure OVPN config to access the isolated game network
- **Admin Panel**: Tools for managing challenges, users, and monitoring system status
- **Dynamic Vulnerability Selection**: Vulnerabilities are selected automatically based on difficulty and randomness


## Technical Architecture
Our project consists of several components:
- **WebServer**: Interface for users and admins
- **Database**: MySQL database for storing all data. Links the WebServer and the GameEngine together.
- **Game Engine**: Core component of the project. Manages game creation, selects vulns, calls the Game-API to start games, calls Healthcheck API Endpoints, ...
- **Game API**: Starts and deletes games via the Proxmox VE API. Also creates and removes VPN clients via the VPN API
- **Proxmox Server**: VMs are created here via the Proxmox VE API. Also hosts the VPN server and Healthcheck service
- **VPN Server**: Provides OpenVPN server and an API, which handles creation and deletion of VPN clients
- **Healthcheck**: Checks if the game VMs are running and if the vulnerable services on these VMs are still operational


## GamePlay

Hackwars is played in a 1v1 format, where each player has their own server to protect.
Each server has a dynamic set of vulnerabilities that players can exploit.
There are two types of vulnerabilities:
- **access**: These vulnerabilities are used to gain access to the target server. They always result in some kind of shell on the target server.
- **privilege escalation**: These vulnerabilities are used to gain root privileges on the target server. They always result in a root shell on the target server.

Access vulnerabilities typically rely on a specific service running on the target server. 
This service must remain operational for the entire game.


Upon a Game Start each player receives the following information:
- **OVPN Config**: A configuration file for OpenVPN, which allows the player to connect to the game network.
- **Server IP**: The IP address of the player's own server.
- **Username & Password**: The username and password for the player's own server.
- **Target IP**: The IP address of the target server.

Then the players can either attack the target server or defend their own server (with patching vulnerabilities).

### Patching Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are mostly implemented via misconfigurations of services or applications.
To Patch Vulnerabilities the player must find those misconfigurations and fix them.

### Win Condition
To win the game, a player must perform a complete attack path on the target machine and gain root access.
For this a minimum of 2 vulnerabilities must be exploited (access & privesc). Then the Player can read out the flag on the target machine under `/root/flag.txt`.
This flag can be submitted via the WebServer to win the Game.

### Disqualifications
A Player is disqualified if any service on his machine is not accessible anymore. Then the Game is instantly deleted, and the
Oppenent wins the Game.
